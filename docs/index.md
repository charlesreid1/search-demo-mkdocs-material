# Searching with Mkdocs-Material

This is a quick demonstration of how to index a large body of links
and make it searchable using the search functionality built into the 
mkdocs-material theme for mkdocs.

This is as simple as it gets: create a directory, put a pile of markdown
files into the directory, and run `mkdocs build` to create a site *and*
a search index.

We document a couple of awesome lists, which are large curated lists of links:

* [awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets/blob/master/README.rst)
* [awesome-big-data](https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata)
* [awesome-vim](https://github.com/akrawchyk/awesome-vim)
* [awesome-rest](https://github.com/marmelab/awesome-rest)
* [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)
* [awesome-r](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R)

To take this thing for a test drive, just start typing into the search box
at the top of the page.

Try searching for the term **healthcare**.
